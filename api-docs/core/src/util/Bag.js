/**
 * @class Ext.util.Bag
 * This class provides an **unordered** collection similar to `Ext.util.Collection`. The
 * removal of order maintenance provides a significant performance increase. Further, this
 * class does not provide events or other high-level features. It maintains an array of
 * `items` and a map to quickly find items by their `id`.
