 * The 'd3-horizontal-tree' component is a perfect way to visualize hierarchical
 * data as an actual tree in case where the relative size of nodes is of little
 * interest, and the focus is on the relative position of each node in the hierarchy.
 * A horizontal tree makes for a more consistent look and more efficient use of space
 * when text labels are shown next to each node.
